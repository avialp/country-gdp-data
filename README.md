# country-gdp-data

## Objective
GDP has always been a measure of a country's success, but what happens when a country sees a sharp drop in their GDP? Here, we aim to understand not only
which countries economies have been growing, but which have been suffering from economic stunting and why that could be. 

## Dataset
This dataset, obtained from Kaggle, highlights the total GDP for 266 countries worldwide from 2013 to 2021. There are columns for the country code, country name, and each 
year with GDPs according to the country. 

## Methods used
In this project, I used a SQlite database to store and query all information. For visualization and data cleaning, I used pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib
libraries to dissect data

## Outcomes
Afghanistan suffered from a sharp decrease in GDP in the year 2019 and began to recover in 2020. In 2021, we see that GDP begins to decrease again for Afghanistan.
We may be able to atrribute this to ongoing conflict, lacks of exports, and depletion of resources

American Samoa also saw an increase in GDP, though not as drastic. On this end, we can attribute this to the lack of exports from around the beginning of the pandemic.
